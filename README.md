# Signify Virtual Meeting Platform

Signify is an innovative virtual meeting platform that bridges communication gaps by converting sign language gestures into text and speech in real-time. This platform enables seamless communication between hearing and non-hearing participants during virtual meetings.

## Core Functionality

- **Sign Language to Text Conversion**: Real-time translation of sign language gestures into text
- **Text to Speech Synthesis**: Automatic conversion of translated text into speech for hearing participants
- **Interactive Chat Box**: Display of translated sign language in the meeting chat
- **Real-time Video Streaming**: High-quality video for accurate gesture recognition
- **Multi-participant Support**: Seamless communication between all meeting participants
